# Career Exploration app

> This app was built for the LLama-3 hackathon in San Francisco.

This app lets people upload their resumes, fill in some of their interests, and get a list of possible careers they could do.

## v1

- [x] Code up a landing page, use PDFToChat/QRGPT as inspo

- [ ] Multi-step form where people can add their interests
- [ ] Possible careers page built with reactflow.dev with timeline, average salary, & difficulty level
- [ ] Modal that provides a plan for how to transition to each career
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow and make sure it works properly
- [ ] Fine-tune Llama-3-8B on making the job plan. Maybe fine-tune Llama-3-8B on GPT-4 outputs
