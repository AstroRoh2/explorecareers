# Career Exploration app

> This app was built for the LLama-3 hackathon in San Francisco.

This app lets people add their resumes/linkedIn, fill in some of their interests, and get a list of possible careers they could do.

## v1

- [x] Code up a landing page, use PDFToChat/QRGPT as inspo
- [ ] Dashboard screen with upload functionality using Bytescale
- [ ] Use PDF parsing logic & add it as context along with the form data
- [ ] Multi-step form where people can add their interests
- [ ] Possible careers page built with reactflow.dev with timeline, average salary, & difficulty level
- [ ] Modal that provides a plan for how to transition to each career
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow and make sure it works properly

## v2 (stretch)

- [ ] Fine-tune Llama-3-8B on making a job plan. Maybe fine-tune Llama-3-8B on GPT-4 outputs
- [ ] Add authentication with Clerk to make people create accounts and remember their resumes
- [ ] Add functionality for people to alternatively paste in their LinkedIn URL instead of resume
- [ ] Add web search logic with Brave to be able to add courses to the app
- [ ] Add: Who do I want to be more like? functionality
- [ ] Add functionality to let users suggest new careers themselves
